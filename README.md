# CLG ASSIGNMENT 6
Lesson 6 - Javascript

INSTRUCTIONS

In the top header, //classed as .logo, if you click this you will get an important alert, and then the text will change to the title of lesson 6 assignment.

i've added an effect to the navigation buttons so when you click them it looks like you're pushing a button. looks siiiieeeck 

You will see I have added in a button at the top of the main section. do not click this button.

I have used JS to change the H1 title in the main content section, as well as the border radius for the image.

when you click the main paragraph text, it will disappear
and there is also an important message underneath which will self destruct after 5 seconds. 

you can click the big button at the bottom as many times as you like to change its colour.
